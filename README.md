# -14-Model-View-Controller-MVC-Tech-Blog

## Introduction:
our task for this assignment was to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site. Where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This site was completely from scratch and deployed to Heroku. The app is supposed to follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure. Use the following: Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.


I created a demo app that you can use on this link:
